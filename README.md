## What is Docker?

Docker is an open source containerization platform. It enables developers to package applications into containersâ€”standardized executable components combining application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.

## Difference between Virtualisation and Containerisation

Virtualization enables you to run multiple operating systems on the hardware of a single physical server, while containerization enables you to deploy multiple applications using the same operating system on a single virtual machine or server.

## Benefeits of Containerisation and Docker?

- Portability
- Efficiency
- Agility
- Faster delivery
- Faster app startup
- Easier management
- Flexibility

## Downsides of Containerisation

All containers on a particular host machine must be designed to run on the same kind of OS. Containers based on a different OS will require a different host. 

Because the OS is shared, a security vulnerability in the OS kernel is a threat to all containers on the host machine. That being said containers are isolated from one another, you can be confident that your applications are running in their own self-contained environment. That means that even if the security of one container is compromised, other containers on the same host remain secure.  

Containerization is still a new solution with wide variances in implementation plans and skilled resources, making adoption a challenging process for some.

## What is MicroServices Architecture

A monolithic application is built as a single unified unit while a microservices architecture is a collection of smaller, independently deployable services.

Communicate using API's.

## Who is using Docker?

- Spotify 
- Uber
- Many other large companies too.

## Commands

```
docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx  # runs the nginx image on port 80 (and detached)
docker stop CONT_ID  # stops the container
docker start CONT_ID  # runs the container (from the stopped position)
docker rm CONT_ID -f # deletes the container
docker ps  # shows running containers
docker images  # lists the images
docker rmi IMG_ID  # deletes the image
```

## How to push to Dockerhub (nginx example)

### Create repository on Docker hub

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110126036/189679597-0f39bb7e-4804-422d-ba12-5d3dca362d5d.png)

### Retrieve Nginx image

```
docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx
```

-d means it runs detached -p allows to define ports (useful for reverse proxy)


### Edit the image

```
docker exec -it CONT_ID bash
```

introduces interactive bash script where you are root user (where you can make changes to the image)

### Create your own image and push to DockerHub

```
docker commit CONT_ID sam-nginx-playaround  # creates image
docker tag IMG_ID sdennis3141/nginx_tutorial:latest  # tags the image
docker push sdennis3141/nginx_tutorial  # pushes to dockerhub
```

If you get access denied you can run the following command

`docker login -u "myusername" -p "mypassword" docker.io`

#### NOTE TO FIND THE IMAGE ID AND CONTAINER ID USE `docker ps -a` and `docker images`

## Editing from CLI

### Create a html file (named index.html)

```
<html>
<head>
  <title>Welcome to Sam's Website</title>

  <body>
    <h1> Hello there, I am Sam</h1>
    <h2> This website is hosted inside a Container using Docker!</h2>

  </body>
</head>
</html>
```
### Create NGINX Container
`docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx`

### Find out Container ID

#### Note that 96be7be49dcf is the container ID

### Now delete the existing file with nginx

`docker exec 96be7be49dcf rm -rf /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html`

### Replace the deleted file with the above html file

`docker cp index.html 96be7be49dcf:/usr/share/nginx/html`

### And it is finished

## Creating a web server using Dockerfile

### Create index.html

```
<html>
<head>
  <title>Welcome to Sam's Website</title>

  <body>
    <h1> Hello there, I am Sam</h1>
    <h2> This website is hosted inside a Container using Docker!</h2>

  </body>
</head>
</html>
```

### Create a Dockerfile

```
# Select NGINX base image
FROM nginx

# label it
LABEL MAINTAINER=sdennis@spartaglobal.com

# copy data from localhost to the container
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/

# allow required port
EXPOSE 80

# execute required command
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

```

### Build the image 

`docker build -t sdennis3141/eng122_nginx_tutorial_web_hosting:v1.0 .`

### Run the image

`docker run -d -p 80:80 sdennis3141/eng122_nginx_tutorial_web_hosting:v1.0`

### And it is finished
